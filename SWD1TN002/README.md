# SWD1TN002 - Ohjelmointi (Java)

## java-autovuokraus *(car rental)*

An application for listing and registering car rentals. This is a first year final project at Haaga-Helia, and one of my first Java applications. Its design might be a bit unorthodox, and it relies a bit too much on client validation, but I decided to put it into working condition again and share it here. It uses plain servlets, JSP pages and jQuery UI.
